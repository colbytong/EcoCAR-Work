# EcoCAR-Work
Programs written for the Connected and Automated Vehicles team on UW EcoCAR.
We are currently working on developing lane tracking algorithms. More specifically, we are writing code to cluster relevant data from sensors on the car and then run that data through a Kalman filter to eliminate noisy data points and predict the lane ahead of the car.
